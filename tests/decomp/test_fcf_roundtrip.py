"""Cut-level round-trip test for the boundary FCF importer (epic 4 ticket-013).

Proves the authored checkpoint's coefficients are value-faithful to the
source cuts: this module independently parses a hand-authored
``BoundaryCuts``/``TerminalManifest``/``DecompIdMap``, writes and reloads it
through ``synthetic_roundtrip`` (no deck, no cobre binary), and cross-
evaluates its cut coefficients against a *direct, independent* evaluation —
never through :func:`cobre_bridge.decomp.fcf.mapper.map_boundary_cuts`, the
mapper's own coefficient placement, which would make this a circular,
Python-vs-Python check. It instead builds its own physical<->slot join from
the *reloaded* ``entity_manifest`` — the ground truth for where the writer
actually placed each mapped coefficient — via this module's own
``_resolve``/``_theta_source``/``_theta_cobre`` oracle.

Agreement to f64 tolerance (``policy.fbs`` stores ``coefficients`` as
``float64``, so authored values round-trip through cobre-io exactly) across
both a direct coefficient comparison and a deterministic evaluation sweep
catches a sign flip, a unit error, a lag off-by-one, or a dropped
``cost_scale_factor`` marker (which makes cobre silently scale every value
by 10⁶) in one test.

Gated on ``@requires_cobre_python`` (cobre is import-able) stacked with
``@requires_writer_binding`` (the installed wheel actually exposes the
``write_policy_checkpoint`` binding this path calls — an older, importable
wheel lacking it would otherwise fail at runtime with ``AttributeError``
instead of skipping).
